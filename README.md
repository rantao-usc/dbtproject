# PostgreSQL Data Transformation with dbt

This repository contains a data transformation project using dbt (Data Build Tool) on data hosted in a PostgreSQL database. The PostgreSQL instance is containerized using Docker, providing a flexible and isolated environment for database operations.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the use of dbt for transforming data within a PostgreSQL database. dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouses more effectively by writing select statements in SQL and managing these transformations as code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Docker is used to host the PostgreSQL database.
- dbt: You will need dbt installed to run the transformation jobs. Visit [dbt installation guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) for instructions.

### Setup

1. **Docker PostgreSQL Container**
   - To set up the PostgreSQL database in Docker, run the following command:
     ```
     docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
     ```
   - This command creates a new Docker container named `some-postgres` with PostgreSQL. Replace `mysecretpassword` with a secure password of your choice.

2. **Configure dbt**
   - Navigate to the dbt project directory and update the `profiles.yml` file with the credentials of your PostgreSQL database hosted in Docker.
   - Ensure the dbt profile is correctly set to connect to your PostgreSQL instance.

### Running dbt Transformations

Execute the dbt run command from the root of your dbt project to start the data transformation process:

```
dbt run
```

This command compiles the SQL models and runs them against your database, applying the transformations as defined in your dbt project.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the data transformations or extending the project, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
